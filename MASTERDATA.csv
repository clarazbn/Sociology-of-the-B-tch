M,JACK,1,"Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit  into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big."

M,GAUNT YOUNG MAN,1,"Fuck yeah bitch. You are a stupid fucker if you don't believe in God. The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell... GAUNT YOUNG MAN  As soon as you realize that the random events in your life are God...you will live a much better life. You spend your life believing that you have all the control over what happens. Bullshit. The plane you are flying goes down? Out of your control. God gives you cancer. I have no control over that. Did God give me cancer? You bet your ass God gave me cancer. You think if I begged for cancer God would have given it to me? No...because I assure you I have begged for God to take it away  and guess what? I have no control over that. GAUNT YOUNG MAN smokes the cig to the nub and rubs the remains against the smooth concrete wall. GAUNT YOUNG MAN  Can I get another smoke? What's wrong with you honey? You are beautiful, do you know that? Do I scare you? People either have to pretend they don't see me or they are drawn to me. It's funny because people see me as being close to the other side  they feel like I have power or wisdom. They think I have the answers. Who knows? Maybe I do. Death gives you perspective. I lived my life so indecisive, in a haze. But now that I am dying everything is so clear. It all makes sense somehow. I am sorry but I can't get over how beautiful you are? Look at your arm, you an addict? NICOLE looks at him. She nods. GAUNT YOUNG MAN  What's your name?"

M,SANTANICO,1,"Let's see if you taste as good as your brother. She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified. Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the FLOOR and INTO the WALL. A badass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps. Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other. The bikerwinner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE, goes head to head with a stripper. The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow. Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her on the wooden leg. FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie appears, straight razor in hand. Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half. Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue in Razor Charlie's heart. Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the vampire's death scream. Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest."

M,SPREG,3,"Get the bitches. Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us.  Diamanda is screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots Replay four more times. We spin oneeighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM BLAM  BLAM  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun toward us. We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running. Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward. Freighttrain doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to us. We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel. Backing away from it. We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns over the roar of the train. Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and running. Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to fill the night. Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest. We move forward into the dark trainyard as THE TAPE ENDS. And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular."
M,MAX,3,"Fucking bitch BLAM  BLAM  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away... His hair comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig, containing the squidnet array.  Max's head is shaved to a Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with effort as he struggles with Lenny. He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.   of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards. The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above. Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one advantage Max has managed to make him really angry. Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room, falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a splitsecond before his hand touches it.  It skitters under the couch, out of play. Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes down to one knee. Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away from the downthrust. The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away, pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass. Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny twists with all his strength and spins Max into the railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and Max topples. As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he is being strangled by the tie. Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max sees it coming a split second before it happens. Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's hands. Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck. Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor. Fireworks continue to boom across the sky. Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her. He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps walking. "
M,SPREG,3,"YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and... Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take the fire, and... POW POW POW  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire. He drops like a sack of cement. The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive. He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He opens his eyes."

M,JAKE,na,"Let's get it straight up front. I don't want your pity. I know the world's a coldass bitch. Jake's eyes shift    HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with. Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away. CU JAKE  not looking away."
M,JAKE,na,"Yeah, yeah. The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it's like fieldstripping a weapon. Repetition. THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips."

M,DECKARD,na,"But so far they had always managed to keep it quiet.  Not to say that once in a while there wasn't bad publicity.  Some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aunAmerican for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony. The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button and Deckard walks away."
M,CLIFF,na,What are you bitching about now?
M,MASON,na,"Yeah, okay, I know you are joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you are also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an inbetween state. Not really experiencing anything."
M,DR CHAPMAN,na,That technique ... I have tried it. A nice effect. But highly unstable. In six months she will look like Grandma Moses.

And if you are looking for kindness and compassion, they are in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I am in it up to my elbows. I have seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they are the last stop between you and six feet under.

It said, Life is a bitch... then you die. well ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to indulge in fantasies, but in political and economic reality. America has become a second rate power. Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. In the days of the 'free market' when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the shareholders. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the man who built this industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today management has no stake in the company. Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3 and where does Mr. Cromwell put his million dollar salary? Certainly not in Teldar stock, he owns less than 1. You own Teldar Paper, the stockholders, and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, golf and hunting trips, corporate jets, and golden parachutes Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200,000 a year.

M,FROST,son of a bitch,"Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead. They thought they killed everybody, and except for me, they were right. But it wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade blew up right next to me, that's why I am so pretty. They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour... As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE say MALE VOICE  Thirst. Who the fuck was that? he thinks to himself. He turns around nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says FEMALE VOICE  Thirst. We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer. SEX MACHINE  Stop fucking saying that TWO MALE VOICES  Thirst SEX MACHINE  That bite weren't nothin'. It just hurt like a sonofabitch, that's all. It barely punched the skin. Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are many voices, male, female, children saying"

M,BILL THE BUTCHER,son of a bitch,"You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport. Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch. And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand like lightning. And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING. Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the Butcher... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each other... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam. And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers. And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny ES her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to the main floor. The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN. In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike."
M,BILL THE BUTCHER,son of a bitch,"They know me by any name, you son of a bitch The crowd ERUPTS this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down and cool him off."
M,CAESAR,son of a bitch,"Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he? Jerome halfsmiles, realizing that the conversation is for his benefit.  Having made it clear that they do not intend to expose their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds. Jerome crushes his paper cup.  Forgetting himself, he drops the cup into the wastebasket. "

M,TRACKING,son of a bitch,"Pulling Bernie as he runs.  Foreground trees flash by.  In the background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling at his side. Boomanother gun blast.  Running, Bernie reacts, but Tom has only fired into the ground. On the echo of the shot we cut to   WIDE   THE ROAD TicTac and Frankie are leaning against the car, trading the flask back and forth. In the background, Tom emerges from the woods. Frankie Put one in his brain? Tom takes a few steps more before answering Tom Yeah. Frankie Attaboy. Over black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a phone box. Looking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone booth on a dark corner.  Tom stands inside the booth waiting, the receiver to his ear. Tom Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where have you been?. . .  ON TOM Inside the phone booth. Well you are lucky, Bluepoint's been looking for you.  Bernie's deadStop wailing and listen to me.  Caspar knows you were in on selling out his fix. . . I guess I gave him that idea.  Sorry Mink, we were chatting and it just slipped out. Shutup and let me talk.  You have gotta make yourself missing, but let me know where you hole up.  You are gonna say some things for me. . . Some stories.  About Bluepoint, to Caspardon't worry, I will let you know.  For now just dis appear. . . Yeah, I got you into it.  Just remember, Mink, I am the only one who can get you out. Tom hangs up the phone, turns around and opens up the glass door. WHOMMMP  A fist slams into his stomach, driving him back into the phone booth, knocking his hat off of his head. The man who hit him leans down, picks up the hat, dusts it off and hands it into the booth.  It is Dead Terry, the tall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leo's office. A cigarette dangles from his lower lip. Behind him a black sedan is parked at the curb.  Three or four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and down the road. Tom looks up, the color drained from his face, and reaches feebly out for his hat. Tom Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote? Dead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles. Terry Message from Leo.  Leo says, if you are smart you will sit this one outnot that he cares one way or the other.  Leo says if you are on the wrong side you take your chances, like anyone else.  Leo says he gives no special favors. That's all. Tom Mm. . . Terry starts to turn away. Tell Leo he's not God on the throne, he's just a cheap mick political boss with no brains and an office that looks like a French whore house. Tom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his shoulder. Terry One more thing. . . He cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook, knocking him back into the booth again. Tom rubs his chin, looking up at Terry. Tom Leo say that too. . . ? As Terry and the gunmen get into the car Terry No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next time I will say plenty. We  as the door slams and the car roars off. Over black we hear Caspar When you are right you are right, but you never say I told you so. On Tom, sitting into frame in Caspar's office. Tom So what am I right about? Behind his desk, Caspar is smiling. Caspar Well, I will tell ya, but first you gotta promise not to say I told you so. Tom's eyes hold an Caspar's.  He is taking out a pack of cigarettes. Tom I never say that.  And I don't like people who do. Caspar Mink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah. Tom What convinced you of that? Caspar Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't find him. Bluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal ly, I think you were right.  I think Mink and Bernie was in it together.  I think Mink heard you had bumped the Motzah, and lit out.  The lousy sonofabitch. His eyes on Caspar, Tom takes out a cigarette, lights it, takes a deep drag. Tom I told you so. Caspar laughs. Caspar Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all right.  I don't generally care for it, but that's all right. . . You were a good sport to bump the Motzah.  I just like to make sure my friends is my friends.  So. He throws his hands up. Friends, right? Tom How d'you know Mink skipped? Caspar Bluepoint can't find him. Tom So he says. Caspar stares at Tom. Caspar Meanin' what, exactly? Tom Maybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought until now, since a guy will say pretty much anything when he knows his number is up, but just before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up.  That they were the ones that were selling out your fix. Caspar looks at Tom. Caspar Zat so. . . He thinks for a beat. Like you say, a guy will say anything. Tom Uhhuh.  So why isn't Bluepoint here? Caspar Well. . . He figdets. He don't care for you, kid.  Maybe it's only fair to tell you. . .  After you left us, he tried to sell me on a doublecross.  He says to me, why don't we doublecross you and give you the bump once we get the Motzah.  But I figure a deals a deal, you are square with me, you bump the Motzah, I will hold up my end.  Question of ethics. Everything above board, that's how I like it, so everybody knows who's a friend and who's an enemy. . .  But Bluepoint wouldn't cross me.  We go back. Tom Uhhuh. . . Course, there's always that wild card when love is involved. . . Caspar is staring intently at Tom.  After a beat Caspar I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still don't make it that way. Tom Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to worry about. Caspar seems lost in thought Caspar Yeah. . . We hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny Jr. runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper. Johnny Jr. Poppa  Poppa  I got a prize from the Caspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster, still looking at Tom. Caspar Just a minute. As Tom rises to his feet Course, there's no reason not to be careful Johnny Jr. Poppa  Poppa  The sisters gave me aunnnh Cascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head. He points at Tom. Caspar Shaddap  You take a page outta this guy's book. A little less you talk and a little more you think Cascar looks at Tom and smiles. Kids.  Ya gotta be firm.  Anyways.  You know what I am sayin'.  No reason to worry but no reason not to investigate, neither.  If Mink is around I want you to find him.  He can tell us what's what. . . What's a matter, somebody hit you, what's a matter, we ain't friends anymore?. . . He picks up Johnny Jr., who is crying softly, and sets him in his lap.  Encouraged by the attention, the child starts wailing.  Caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his voice over the sobs If you find him, I wanna talk to him alone. That's how you get the straight dope.  Manto man.  Just me, Mink. . . He pats his jacket where his shoulder holster is. and my friend roscoe.  Y'understand what I am sayin'? Tom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette. Tom It ain't complicated.  SHOT   A MAN'S FACE Crunchbeing hit by a gloved hand. The blow and the man's grunt echo.  ON A NEWSPAPER As the noise of fists against flesh continues, echoing, in the background. The newspaper headline reads PARTY BOSS LOOSES MUNICIPAL CONTRACT.  The subhead reads  Liam  O'Bannon Removed From City Highway Commission  New Construction Contracts To Raffo Bros."
M,REVERSE,son of a bitch,"On Tom.  In the background, Bluepoint is walking over to the door to the room to close it. Bluepoint That ain't all we know, smart guy. He points with a nod towards the couch. Recognize your playmate? On the couch sits Drop Johnson.  Drop's face looks worked on, and is beaded over with sweat. Having shut the door, Bluepoint is sauntering over to Tom. Yeah.  You thought I had quit. He shakes his head. Huhuh.  I followed you this afternoon.  And I wondered why Einstein would want to talk to a gorilla. . . He is nose to nose with Tom, smiling at him. So I grabbed the gorilla. . . And I beat it out of him. He shrugs. Give me a big guy, every time.  They crack easy.  Not like you. Tom holds Bluepoint's look. Tom Is there a point?  Or are you just brushing up on your small talk? Bluepoint I like that.  Cool under fire.  I am impressed. Very quickly he delivers two slapsforehand and backhand. Tom's head rocks but he recovers to stare back at Blue point. The gorilla didn't know whose stiff we found, but I can fill that in.  You killed Mink, you sonofabitch. He grabs Tom by the lapels, swings him away from the desk, and lands a punch on his chin. Tom stumbles backs. Caspar has turned from the fireplace, watching the doings across the room. Bluepoint moves towards Tom, breathing hard with antici pated pleasure. Come here, bum.  I am gonna send you to a deep dark place.  And I am gonna have fun doing it. Bluepoint's hand snakes out and grabs Tom by the front of the coat, hauling him close.  He slaps him savagely. It was Mink, and by God I will hear you say it Tom Is this how you taught Drop his story? In one motion Bluepoint's hands wrap around Tom's throat choking him off.  As the pressure increases, Tom, purpling, sinks to his knees. Bluepoint I like the way you think.  Maybe when you are dead I will cut your head off, put it on my mantle WHANGa shovel blade swings into frame to smash Bluepoint in the face. He drops. From somewhere in the room, a scream. Bluepoint is on his hands and knees, one hand pressed over his ruined face, blood pouring from between the fingers. Caspar Sonafabitch. . . He stands over Bluepoint with the fireplace shovel. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a doublecross artist.  I had a feeling 'bout this sonofabitch He swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to the top of Bluepoint's head. Bluepoint drops to the floor, instantly motionless. The scream, however, continues. Drop Johnson, on the couch, his eyes wide, his hands spastically squeezing his knees, is looking down at Bluepoint.  Drop's mouth is stretched wide.  He is scream ing. Tom gets slowly to his feet. Cascar looks at Drop. Shut it, you sonofabitch He is striding over to him with the shovel. I will give you something to holler about Tom intercepts him. Tom Johnny.  It's okay.  Bluepoint made him.  It's okay.  It's not important. Caspar is panting. Caspar Then have him shut it Drop does. There is a beat. Incongruously, Caspar's bellow breaks the silence And we do the same to Mink  This very same night Another silence.  The rain.  The crackle of the fire. Tom's tone is soothing Tom Johnny.  We can't doublecross him.  He wants to spill the whole setup Caspar stares at him through glazed eyes. Caspar I have never let a sonofabitch walk Tom You have never crossed anyone . . . Caspar is staring at him.  His eyes have lost some of their glaze. Tom Four o'clock, my place.  Mink's coming in on his own hook so I promised him the money. Don't make me out a liar Drop is suddenly screaming again. Caspar looks where Drop is looking Bluepoint is raising his head, moaning.  His face is a mask of blood.  One hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his gun. Caspar shouts over Drop's howl as he pulls something from his desk drawer Caspar Lookit this, kid. He strides over to Bluepoint. Something I try and teach all my boys. . . With the gun point blank against the back of Bluepoint's head, he fires. Tom recoils. Always put one inna brain   A CLOCK A large wall clock.  It is 330. We are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a diner we are isolating on a section of counter on which sits a halfempty cup of coffee and an ashtray halffilled with butts.  A hand puts some change on the counter and leaves frame.   "
M,POV,son of a bitch,"In the middle foreground Caspar lies an the floor beyond him, Bernie leans against the doorframe in Tom's open doorway, smiling, his arms folded over his chest. The balusters stretch away in a regular line, throwing vertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall. Bernie I get it.  You set me up. Tom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at Caspar. Bernie Anything to avoid a little dirty work yourself, huh? Tom doesn't answer. How had you know held get it and not me?  Or didn't you care? Tom shrugs, still staring down at Caspar. Tom I figured you had come early, and be looking for blood.  He wouldn't, so you had likely have the drop on him. Bernie takes his gun out of his overcoat packet and saunters over. Bernie You are a sonofabitch, Tom.  I like the way you think.  You are right, the bonehead never knew what hit him. He looks down at Caspar, unable to supress a smile. But if you knew I had come looking to kill you, how do you know I won't still? Tom shrugs again. Tom Nothing in it for you, now.  With him dead we got nothing on each other.  Let me have the gun. Bernie Why? Tom jerks his head towards Caspar. Tom Pin this on Bluepoint.  Neither of us wants him walking around after this. Bernie shakes his head. Bernie The cops will be Leo's now.  They won't care what they hang Bluepoint for. Tom shrugs again. Tom I guess that's so.  If you don't mind keeping the gun that killed Caspar.  And Mink. He stoops down over Caspar's body and starts feeling through Caspar's pockets, looking for something. Why did Mink shoot Rug, anyway? Bernie is walking towards him, emptying the bullets from his gun. Bernie I dunno, it was just a mixup.  Here. Tom looks back over his shoulder.  Bernie hands him the gun, which Tom slips into his overcoat packet. So you are gonna say Bluepoint did this? As he goes back to the body Tom Mink thought Rug was tailing him? He finds Caspar's gun and sets it on the floor, but keeps looking. Bernie Yeah yeah, you know Mink.  Hysterical.  Skin full of hop, head full of bogeymen.  Comes home crying one day, said he had to pop a guy, one of Bluepoint's spies. Tom Rug was following Verna, not Mink.  Mink just happened to be with her. He has found a wallet and is thumbing through it. Bernie Yeah.  Funny, ain't it?  But you know, Mink was terrified Bluepoint had find out me and him were jungled up together. Tom has taken out the money, rifles it, and replaces the wallet. Tom And I will bet you had kept him plenty worried about that, to keep him under your thumb. Bernie Yeah, so what . . . Bernie is peering over Tom's shoulder at the monev. Scratch, huh?  A  little bonus? Tom straightens up, Caspar's gun in hand. Tom Why did Mink take Rug's hair? Bernie shrugs. Bernie Beats me, the kid was dizzy.  Fiftyfifty on the dough?  Or maybe I should get a little more, since I did the deed. Tom is stuffing the money into his pocket. Okay, you keep it.  I want you to have it. Tom Bernie. . . He nods towards Caspar's body. We can't hang this on Bluepoint. Bernie Huh?  Why not? Tom Bluepoint's already dead, halfway 'cross town. Bernie's smile is fading. Bernie What the hell are you talking about? Tom Bluepoint's dead.  It's gotta be you.  I mean hell, it's your gun. Alarm is beginning to rise Bernie What is this  What the hell are you talking about . . . He looks down at Caspar and then back at Tom. You took my gun  Just your word against mine Tom pops the chamber of Caspar's gun, glances in, and snaps it shut. Tom Not necessarily. Bernie's eyes widen. Bernie Are you crazy  We are square  You said it yourself  We got nothing on each other Tom Yup. Bernie fights against hysteria Bernie So what's in it for you?  There's no angle  You can't just shoot me, like that He sinks to his knees, his voice rising. Jesus Christ  It don't make sense  Tommy Look in your heart Tom What heart. BANGBernie splays backwards from the knees, a bullet drilled neatly through his forehead. Tom drops the gun by Caspar's body. Unpocketing Bernie's gun, Tom goes over to his corpse and drops it there. We pan with Tom's legs to bring his doorway into view as he walks into his apartment, to the window chair in the background, and sits with his back to us. The windows show daylight breaking.  Far away a clock strikes the quarter hour. Tom is picking up the phone and dialing.  Waiting for an answer, he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow lamp burning chairside. As we start to , we can hear Tom talking into the phone Tom Tony?  Tom.  Tell Lazarre I have got his money. . . Yeah, all of it.  And I want to place a bet on tonight's fight. . . A  OF "
M,THE HALLWAY,son of a bitch,"Of Leo's club, leading to his office. We are tracking over Tom's shoulder as he walks down the hall, led by Dead Terry. Terry They set you up downstairs? Tom How's that? Terry Hootch?  Whatever? Tom gestures with the drink he is carrying.  Its ice cubes clink. Well thanks for coming, Tom.  Leo's real anxious to see you. . . Tom Yeah.  I happened to be near. We can hear muffled bellowing coming from Leo's office, growing louder as we approach. Terry seems embarassed Terry Actually. . . this might not be the best time. . . They have pulled up in front of the closed door to Leo's office. Leo's bellowing, inside, abates for a moment.  We can hear another voice, muffled so that we don't hear words, but only the voice's plaintive quality. Leo's bellowing cuts it short. Tom Who's he got in there? Terry O'Gar and the mayor. As he leaves frame Tom I will try again. Terry calls after him Terry I will tell him you stopped by.   DOWNSTATRS Pulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor, drink still in hand. Behind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage done to the club in the police raid. Halfway across the floor Tom stiffens and slows, seeing something. Verna is entering the club. The two meet. Tom Lo, Verna. Verna See Leo? They both lean against a counterstop and look out at the floor. Tom He was busy. Verna You should see him.  He has something to tell you. Tom Maybe I will run into him. Verna Bernie's funeral is tomorrow.  You could stop by. Tom Maybe. Verna Leo has something to tell you. Tom So you said. There is a silent beat.  Verna scowls. Verna Tell me something, Tom.  Why didn't you tell me what was going on?  I thought he was dead, and you never Tom There was no point in telling you.  It could only have queered things if it had gotten out Verna Jesus, Tom  You don't just talk to people for the play it gives you or doesn't give you  I suffered, you noheart son of a bitch Tom lets this drift. Verna tries to compose herself. I am sorry.  It's just that things might have been different.  With us.  If I had known that you hadn't. . . done anything to him. . . Tom You know now. Verna looks at him intently. Verna What happened that night? Tom still looks at her evenly. Tom I went to a bar.  Passed out.  When I got back to my place they were both dead. Verna studies him. Verna Passed out, huh? Tom Yeah. She looks at him a beat more, then out at the floor. Verna It's funny. . . I have never even seen you sleep though you told me once about a dream you had. Tom Maybe I lied. WHAP  Verna slaps him hard.  His head rocks under the blow. Verna You have never been straight with me about any thing  You are a sonofabitch She stalks off. Tom watches her go. He raises the drink and rolls it across his slapped cheek. The ice cubes clink.   CEMETARY An small old marble orchard set on a hilltop cleared against the woods.  Stars of David adorn the headstones in the foreground Bernie's funeral is ending.  Present is a rabbi, just finishing the chanting of the liturgy, Verna, and Leo. In the background, on the road at the foot of the hill, Tom is emerging from a taxi.  It rolls away as he starts up the hill. Just as he arrives, Leo and Verna turn to leave. Tom takes in the scene. Tom Big turnout. Verna Drop dead. She stalks off, leaving Leo and Tom alone.  Leo takes off his yarmulke and fiddles with it uncomfortably.  The two men start walking. Leo She's under a lot of strain. Tom Well, at least she didn't hit me. Leo chuckles. They walk on. Leo Tommy, I am glad you came. . . Tom She's taking the car. Leo Huh? Leo looks up. Verna is getting into the elegant black touringcar that waits at the bottom of the hill.  It pulls away. Leo looks at Tom. I guess we are walking. Tom I guess we are. They walk in silence for a beat. Leo We are getting married. Tom stiffens.  He brings out Tom Congratulations, Leo. Leo too is uncomfortable. Leo The funny thing is. . . She asked me.  To tie the  knot.  I guess you are not supposed to say that. Tom It doesn't matter.  Congratulations. Leo Thanks. . . Hell, Tom  Why didn't you tell me what you were up to?  I thought you had really gone overnot that I didn't deserve it.  But you could have told me. Tom Telling you could only have queered things if it had. . . Tom cuts himself off and walks in silence for a moment. There just wasn't any point. Leo wants to be encouraging.  He nods. Leo I can see that.  Well.  It was a smart play, all around.  I guess you know I am grateful. Tom No need. Leo is grinning again. Leo I guess you picked that fight with me just to tuck yourself in with Caspar. Tom I dunno.  Do you always know why you do things, Leo? Leo greets this with a puzzled Smile. Leo Course I do. He nods to himself. It was a smart play. They walk on. Tom You will do fine. Leo stops, grabs Tom's arm, and the words come cut in a rush Leo Jesus, Tom  I had give anything if you had work for me again  I know I have made some bonehead plays  I know I can be pigheaded but, damnit, so can you  I need your help, and things can be like they were, I know it  I just know it  As for you and Vernawell I understand, you are both young, andwell, damnit, Tom, I forgive you Tom instantly bristles.  For the first time, his tone is sharp Tom I didn't ask for that and I don't want it. The two men stare at each otherTom's look angry Leo's, distraught. Tom's look softens. Goodbye, Leo. Leo still stares at him, waiting for something else. When nothing is forthcoming he turns and walks away. Tom watches him go.  He unpockets a flask and raises it to his lips. Behind him a tree soughs in the wind. "

M,NECKBONE,son of a bitch,I knew it I told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble. Did they say what he did?
M,TOM,son of a bitch,"Right. The real reason Mud's in the trouble he's got is because of her. He's been in love with that girl since he was your age. They used to run all around here and it was the same back then. He had follow that girl wherever she led him. Problem is she don't care about nobody but herself. I have told him as much. She had bed down with the meanest snake she could find, then when things went bad she had go runnin' to Mud. Mud would take her back, then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat em til they knew to never touch her again. And this time I guess he thought a beating wasn't good enough. Had to shoot that fella. I don't know for sure, but I had put money on Juniper knowin' he had do it. And I have a suspicion she might of even told him to. Either way, those two are set for failure. Only chance Mud has is to cut her loose. Cause I will tell you what, Mud's no bad ass. He's runnin' scared. Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk."

So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'...

M,WURLITZER,son of a bitch,"This son of a bitch is chairman of the prison board, but it's like pullin' teeth to get him down to a prison."
M,WAYNE,son of a bitch,"My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I am all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I am tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you are insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We are talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We will make their motives so blatant, we will shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?"
M,WAYNE,son of a bitch,"Rape and pillage the first episode, just change the order a bit. Those sons of bitches out there ain't gonna know the difference. All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway. We film a new intro. Show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of Mickey and Mallory. We introduce a new angle... what the prison board is up to. We see some of that new shit, then the rest of the show is the interview. Now what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh, Julie make a note I need Woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five' broadcast to promote next weeks show. We will do a feed right from the jail while we are wrapping up with Mickey. Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott."
M,WURLITZER,son of a bitch,I will be a son of a bitch. There's a riot going on in the laundry room. DEPUTY SHERIFF  Is it serious?
M,WAYNE,son of a bitch,"What would I do? Me and my network would sue the entire Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for flagrantly disregarding my safety. I had go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line. In fact, I had sue every man down there personally. I would make it my life's ambition to bring the LA County Jail to its knees. I would do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and the inhumanity that exists here.

It is frightening even now he is a clown, but he is a dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and pale  it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and he is struggling to control himself.

It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west.

A mortar shell lands so close it knocks them down, drenching them with slimy black mud.  The radio disappears in the water. Rising, Brewer takes a round in the thigh.  Drops. Disappears for a second... comes up gasping. Rambo watches the UH60 diminishing to a black dot. He is so consumed with rage that his expression goes slack... blank... a murderous disconnection from conscience. And yet, in that same moment, a tremendous surge of blind will clears his mind, a determination to survive, to get out at whatever cost... to find whoever did this. It is no longer just a mission.  It is a very personal piece of business. He turns and lets his rifle drop into the water.  He takes De Fravio's and throws it away."

But give her a look, like you are gonna smash her in the face next.  Watch her shut the fuck up.  Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around.  So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy.  So what you gotta do is break that sonofa bitch in two.  If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers.  The little one.  Then you tell 'im his thumb's next.  After that he will tell ya if he wears ladies underwear.
