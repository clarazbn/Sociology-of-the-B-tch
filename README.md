 _Investigating the social meaning of the b-word in film_

This project sets out to analyze the presence of the term 'bitch' in a repertoire of over 1000 movie scripts. The database of movie scripts was scrapped and parsed by @AdeboyeML and made available [here](https://github.com/AdeboyeML/Film_Script_Analysis/blob/master/imsdbfilmscripts/10-Things-I-Hate-About-You.txt). I created a d3 chart that I embedded in scrollama to present my findings in a visually appealing way. 

This repo contains 
- the dataset that I analyzed in format pkl
- the code that I wrote to fetch the lines where the word 'bitch' appeared
- the clean excel spreadsheet with all the lines where the word was used to describe female characters, the name and gender of the character speaking, and the level of vulgarity
- the HTML code to my page

Take a look at the final project [here](https://clarazbn.github.io/Sociology-of-the-B-tch/)
